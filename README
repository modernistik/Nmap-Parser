Nmap/Parser
============================

parse nmap scan data with perl

This module implements a interface to the information contained in an nmap scan.
It is implemented by parsing the xml scan data that is generated by nmap. This
will enable anyone who utilizes nmap to quickly create fast and robust security scripts
that utilize the powerful port scanning abilities of nmap.

INSTALLATION

Latest version: http://code.google.com/p/nmap-parser/
Website:        http://anthonypersaud.com/


MANUAL INSTALL

Download the file and unpack. This is usually done by:

   tar zxvf Nmap-Parser-x.xx.tar.gz

Where x.xx is the version number. Next change into the newly created directory.
To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you would like to install Nmap-Parser in a different directory (or if you do
not have root access use 'perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/install/path', where
/install/path is the directory in which you want to install the module. Note
that you should then use the "use lib '/install/path'" in your scripts.


ACTIVESTATE PERL (Perl Package Manager) - MSWin32

Run this in the command prompt:

   ppm install Nmap-Parser

This should contact the ActiveState respository, download the file and install it
automagically.

CPAN AUTOMATIC INSTALL (If you are missing dependencies)

Run this in the command prompt to install directly from CPAN (may need root priviledges):

	perl -MCPAN -e 'install Nmap::Parser'
	

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

	XML::Twig 3.16+
	Storable (comes with Perl 5+)
	

In addition, you will need nmap 3.00+. You don't exactly need it, but this
version of nmap supports the xml output that this module can parse. So, you do
not really need the executable, but the xml output that you will be parsing
(or able to parse), must be from this version onward.
