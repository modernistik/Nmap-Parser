Changes for 1.00
	- To see the changes, please read over the new documentation
		- Internal code is much (MUCH) cleaner and readable
		- removed 'ducttape' fixes and made stable & roubust changes

	- new shortcut functions (for doing repetitive tasks easier)
	- Removed parsing filters (finally)
	- All indexes now start at 0 (not at 1).
	- Removed internal OS generic matching function since this is given by
		nmap now in the osclass tags
	- Removed the use of constants for indexes

	- The use of Storable (dclone) to correctly make duplicate of data structured
	- When filters are used to skip portinfo, all ports return state of 'closed'.
	- Nmap::Parser::XML no longer supported in distribution
		(you should change all calls to Nmap::Parser::XML to Nmap::Parser)

Changes for 0.79
	- fixed ports that were declared as 'open|filtered'
		these now are counted as both 'open' and 'filtered'
		when using tcp_ports() and udp_ports().
	- sent a patch for XML::Twig in order to fix. It is now released in
		XML:Twig 3.16
	- added start_str() and time_str() : they return the human readable format
	of the scan start time and scan finish time (respectively).

Changes for 0.74
	- fixed ip address input bug
	- updated example scripts
	- fixed nmap not found bug
	- updated authorship informatin
	- raised verbose level to 2 in example scripts (help pages)

	- placed sourceforge image link on documentation
	- status_check is now called sweep
	- sweep.pl outputs active IP's to a file with a new command line switch
	- scan_host.pl is renamed to scanhost.pl
	- get_host_list,filter_by_osfamily, filter_by_status returns IP
		addresses in sorted IP order. ( uses sort_ips() )
	- sort_ips is a new function which will take a series of IPs and sort
		them correctly by comparing each quad in the address to each
		other.
	- example scripts use --randomize_hosts to be more stealthy
	- updated information on some example scripts because they require
		nmap 3.50+ for the version scanning.
	- updated parser tests, to check for sorted ip order

	- fixed some example scripts
	- added more tests for the new functionality

Changes for 0.71
	- fixed a small bug in the installation under MSWin32 (PM_FILTER) which
	caused all tests to fail. (It was removing things that weren't comments.

Changes for 0.70
	- updated changes from 0.69
	- updated documentation
	- fixed documentation bug of all the example scripts
	- updated examples script: they are more robust. Can either take
		the example file as input, or actually run scans.

Changes for 0.69
	- new utility script : scan_host.pl
	- added EXAMPLES seciton in documentation
	- parses new 'version', 'extrainfo', and 'product'
		att from service tag (3.40+)
	- added *_service_version to *::Host
	- added xml_version to *::ScanInfo
	- more error prevention mechanisms
	- added os_osfamily, os_gen, os_vendor, os_type added
	- added OSINFO filter
	- ::ScanInfo::scan_types does not return number of scan types in scalar
		format. It will always return an array containing the scan
		types.
	- osfamily does not return the actual string (comma delimited), it always
	returns an array of os matches.
	- DEPRECATED: tcpsequence, ipidsequence, tcptssequence
		now use:
		tcpsequence_class, tcpsequence_values, tcpsequence_index
		ipidsequence_class, ipidsequence_values
		tcptssequence_class, tcptssequence_values


Changes for 0.68
	- Licensing changes, now under GPL
	- added signatures for wireless access points (wap)
	- added os_match shortcut function
	- Problem with Makefile.PL, didn't pass correct dependencies.
	- tcp_port_state() and udp_port_state() return the state of the port
		when passed a port number.
	- Sorted port order when using tcp_ports and udp_ports
	- extraports tag parsing. It is also set up as a filter 'extraports'
		filtering. Added extraports_state and extraports_count to
		Nmap::Parser::Host class.
	- Added and fix some documentation
	- tcp_ports and udp_ports can take a parameter to filter what port list
		you wish to receive. It selects states based on port content
		state tag: filtered, closed, or open
		- previous versions (0.64 or earlier) of the parser, no arguments
	to tcp_ports and udp_ports would return the whole hashref of all the
	ports, this is now deprecated. Use the newly created functions
	tcp_service_name, tcp_service_proto, tcp_service_rpcnum,
	udp_service_name, udp_service_proto, and udp_service_rpcnum.
	- changed default filter for solaris to include 'sun' and not 'sunos'

	- added preliminary callback functionality (for registering events).
		This includes register_host_callback, and reset_host_callback
	- tcp_ports and udp_ports do not return hashref of all ports, only if
		passed a port number as an argument.The argument must be a port
		number. They default to returning an array of port numbers.
	- added short-cuts tcp_ports_count and udp_ports_count functions
	- added tcp_service_proto and udp_service_proto

		OSFAMILY.
	- osclass tag added.
	- a bug found with the sequences is fixed
	- making use of ignore_elts to save when creating objects
	- parse_filters completly excludes tags that you decide not to parse.
		Much faster parsing and memory usage efficiency. efficiency.t
		tests this benchmark to make sure that the twig parser does not
		do any work it doesn't have to.
	- permanently excluding some static tags using ignore_elts.
	- added SCANINFO filter.

Changes for 0.40
	- added new package called ScanInfo (Nmap::Parser::ScanInfo
			this contains methods that make it easier to access the
